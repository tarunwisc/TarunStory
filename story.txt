Billy went to fresh to buy some oranges. He accidentally bought apples instead. When Billy went to the market again we realized he didn't want oranges anyway. We asked Billy that "do you hate orages?" He answered that he doesn't hate, but he doesn't like them much because they are too sour.
The following day Billy again went to the store, but this time he returned with a bag of oranges.
